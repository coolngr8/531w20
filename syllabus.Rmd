* Textbook: R. Shumway and D. Stoffer "Time Series Analysis and its Applications" 4th edition. 
A pdf is available using the UM Library's Springer subscription.
An updated pdf is available free from [David Stoffer's website](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsa4.pdf)
* Pre-requisites:
    + Theoretical statistics. STATS 510 or STATS 426 or equivalent. For review, see "Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis" by J. A. Rice. 
    + Linear algebra. A certain amount of basic linear algebra will be required. For review, see 
[www.sosmath.com/matrix/matrix.html](http://www.sosmath.com/matrix/matrix.html).
    + R programming. There is no formal R prerequisite, but we will be working with R extensively and so you should allow extra time for this course if you are new to R programming.

## Course outline


1. Introduction to time series analysis.

2. Time series models, trend and autocovariance.

3. Stationarity, white noise, and some basic time series models.

4. Linear time series models and the algebra of ARMA models.

5. Parameter estimation and model identification for ARMA models.

6. Extending the ARMA model: Seasonality and trend.

7. Introduction to the frequency domain.

8. Smoothing in the time and frequency domains.

9. Introduction to partially observed Markov process models.

10. Statistical methodology for nonlinear partially observed Markov process models.

11. Dynamic models and their simulation by Eulerâ€™s method.

12. Practical likelihood-based inference for POMP models.

13. POMP models with covariates, and a case study of polio transmission.

14.  A case study using POMP modeling to study financial volatility.

##  Grading

* Weekly homeworks (20\%).
* A midterm exam (20\%, in class on TBD).
* A midterm project analyzing a time series of your choice using methods covered in the first half of the course (20\%, due TBD). 
* A final project analyzing a time series of your choice using methods covered in the entire course (40\%, due TBD). 

Homework will be graded on completeness. 
To get these points, the homework must include two statements titled "Sources" and "Please explain".
 
* The statement of sources must list all books, internet resources or other people consulted while completing the homework. For example, "Sources: notes only," or, "Sources: collaboration with X and Y; web site Z," or, "Sources: notes and office hours."
Any material taken from any source, such as the internet, must be properly acknowledged. 
Directly copied text must be in quotation marks.
Directly copied equations must be explicitly referenced to the source.
Unattributed copying from any source is plagiarism, and has potentially [serious consequences](http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/academic-policies/section11).

* The explanation request provides useful feedback for the GSI and instructor. For example, "Please explain: nothing, everything is clear," or, "Please explain: I'm having difficulties manipulating Taylor series." or, "Please explain: I had difficulty constructing the prewhitening filter. What is a good way to do that in R?"

* Homework will not be graded on correctness, to encourage independent work. The GSI may provide some feedback on correctness, but students are responsible for checking their work against posted solutions.

* The midterm and final projects must take care to properly reference all sources. For projects, no specific source and explanation request statements are requested.
