## Course description

This course gives an introduction to time series analysis using time domain methods and frequency domain methods. 
The goal is to acquire the theoretical and computational skills required to investigate data collected as a time series. 
The first half of the course will develop classical time series methodology, including auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models, regression with ARMA errors, and estimation of the spectral density.
The second half of the course will focus on state space model techniques for fitting structured dynamic models to time series data. 
We will progress from fitting linear, Gaussian dynamic models to fitting nonlinear models for which Monte Carlo methods are required.
Examples will be drawn from ecology, economics, epidemiology, finance and elsewhere.

A course outline, course information and grading policies are described in the [syllabus](syllabus.html).

## Midterm exam information

* The midterm exam is in class on Thursday February 20.

* The exam will involve reasoning about a data analysis using the theoretical and computational techniques we have studied in class. 

* The exam may include techniques covered in homeworks and will assume familiarity with the notes.
Reading the textbook is not mandatory for the exam, but may be useful to get a broader perspective.

* You should bring to the exam just pens and/or pencils. The exam will be taken without any electronic devices, books or notes.

* The best predictor of the style of the exam is the past papers from the 2016 and 2018 versions of this course:

    +  [Midterm exam for STATS 531 Winter 2016](exam/w16/mt531w16.pdf). [Solutions](exam/w16/mt531w16sol.pdf).

    +  [Midterm exam for STATS 531 Winter 2018](exam/w18/mt531w18.pdf). [Solutions](exam/w18/mt531w18sol.pdf).
