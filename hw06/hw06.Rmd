<big><big><big>Objectives</big></big></big>

To gain practical experience working with POMP models, we start with installing the **pomp** package and proceed to two introductory exercises.


------

## Installing the **pomp** package


* Computation time is an unavoidable consideration when working with simulation-based inference, for all but small datasets and simple models. 

* The **pomp** package therefore allows you to specify the most computationally intensive steps---usually, simulation of the stochastic dynamic system, and evaluation of the measurement density---as snippets of C code. 

* Consequently, to use **pomp**, your R program must have access to a C compiler. 
In addition, **pomp** takes advantage of some Fortran code and therefore requires a Fortran compiler. 

* Installing the necessary compilers should be fairly routine, but does involve an extra step beyond the usual installation of an R package, unless you are running the Linux operating system for which they are usually installed by default. Given how fundamental C and Fortran are to scientific computing, it is unfortunate that Mac and Windows do not provide these compilers by default.

* Detailed instructions for installing **pomp** and other software that we will use with it are provided in the following places:

    + The [pomp website installation page](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/install.html)

    + Additional instructions on our [course website](https://ionides.github.io/531w20/pomp_prep/preparation.html)

## Homework problems

Please submit to Canvas an Rmd file addressing the following questions. Your Rmd file can read in the *Parus major* data from the internet, e.g., by
```
dat <- read.csv("https://ionides.github.io/531w20/10/parus.csv")
```

### Question 6.1. Reformulating the Ricker model.

The Ricker equation can be reparameterized so that the scaling of $P_n$ is explicit:
\[
P_{n+1} = r\,P_{n}\,\exp\left(-\frac{P_{n}}{k}\right).
\]
Modify the `pomp` object created in the notes to reflect this reparameterization. Also, Modify the measurement model so that the data $\data{y_n}$ is modeled as 
\[
Y_n |P_n \sim \mathrm{Negbin}(\phi\,P_n,\psi).
\]
Here, $\mathrm{Negbin}(\mu,\psi)$ is the negative binomial distribution with mean $\mu$ and  probability parameter $\psi$, and therefore variance $\mu/\psi$. This parameterization corresponds in R to `rbinom(...,mu,prob)`. See `?rnbinom` for documentation on the negative binomial distribution and [the R Extensions Manual section on distribution functions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Distribution-functions) for information on how to access these in C. 

Try simulating from a few choices of the parameters, and present one simulation from a set of parameters that shows oscillatory behavior.

----------

### Question 6.2. Coding a new model.

Construct a pomp object for the *Parus major* data modeled using the stochastic Beverton-Holt model,
\[
P_{n+1} = \frac{a\,P_n}{1+b\,P_n}\,\varepsilon_n,
\]
where $a$ and $b$ are parameters and
\[
\varepsilon_t \sim \mathrm{Lognormal}(-\tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2,\sigma^2).
\]
Assume the same measurement model as we used for the Ricker model. Try simulating from a few choices of the parameters. What are the similarities and differences between simulations you obtain from the Beverton-Holt model and those from the Ricker model? Present one simulation to support your comments.

----------

### Question 6.3. How long did this homework take?

* This homework is conceptually quite simple, but involves overcoming various technical hurdles. 
The hurdles may be overcome quite quickly, or could turn into a longer battle.

* To make progress on statistical inference for POMP models, we have to solve these underlying computational issues.

* If you get stuck, ask for help from your peers and/or Joonha and/or me. Please report how much time this homework ends up taking, to help me monitor how many difficulties are encountered.
